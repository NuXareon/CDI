print("1+1 =",1+1,'1+2 =',1+2) # print can any number of arguments

use single quotes, or the other way around.

print('"It is in the morning", he mused.')
print("'No! Class is in the afternoon!', she asserted with a smile.")

print('It\'s too late!\nNo, it\'s not!')

In a script, you have to declare print(1+1) to see the result.
