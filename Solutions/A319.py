# 6. Construct a 5-ary prefix code with lengths
L7=[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4]

''' Since r = 5, we can take C = {0,1,2,3,4}.
    Our goal is to find 10 C-words that form
    a prefix code and so that n1=4 have length 1,
    n2=3 have length 2, n3=2 have length 3 and 
    n4=1 has length 4.
    For the n1=4 words of length 1 we can take
    any 4 of the 5 that there are. The simplest choice is
    0, 1, 2 and 3 (we omit quotes to have less clutter).
    Since the code has to be prefix, all other words
    must start with 4. Clearly, 40, 41, 42 is a good
    choice for the n2=3 words of length 2. After that,
    all other code words have to start with 43 or 44.
    We can stick to 43, as we have to write only three
    more words and there are 5 starting with 43. So
    430 and 431 may be taken as the n3=2 words of
    length 3. As word of length 4 we may take 4320,
    the first that avoids 430 and 431.
    Conclusion:'''
